  abstract  = {We present our model of file systems and our merging semantics for resolving conflict updates in geo-distributed file systems. The system model fully describes a file system with all of its components including hard links. This model is able to identify all conflict cases which are classified into direct, such as concurrent updates to the same file, and indirect, such as cycles in the namespace of the file system. The merging semantics resolve all types of conflicts while being able to preserve the effect of all conflict updates. Our implementation of the system and the merging semantics outperforms the existing systems in terms of feature completeness.},

  abstract  = {Replicating data under Eventual Consistency (EC) allows any replica to accept updates without remote synchronisation. This ensures performance and scalability in large-scale distributed systems (e.g., clouds). However, published EC approaches are ad-hoc and error-prone. Under a formal Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) model, we study sufficient conditions for convergence. A data type that satisfies these conditions is called a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). Replicas of any CRDT are guaranteed to converge in a self-stabilising manner, despite any number of failures. This paper formalises two popular approaches (state- and operation-based) and their relevant sufficient conditions. We study a number of useful CRDTs, such as sets with clean semantics, supporting both add and remove operations, and consider in depth the more complex Graph data type. CRDT types can be composed to develop large-scale distributed applications, and have interesting theoretical properties.},

  abstract  = {Cloud apps like Google Docs and Trello are popular because they enable real-time collaboration with colleagues, and they make it easy for us to access our work from all of our devices. However, by centralizing data storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from users. If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost. In this article we propose local-first software, a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration and ownership for users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data. We survey existing approaches to data storage and sharing, ranging from email attachments to web apps to Firebase-backed mobile apps, and we examine the trade-offs of each. We look at Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): data structures that are multi-user from the ground up while also being fundamentally local and private. CRDTs have the potential to be a foundational technology for realizing local-first software. We share some of our findings from developing local-first software prototypes at the Ink &amp; Switch research lab over the course of several years. These experiments test the viability of CRDTs in practice, and explore the user interface challenges for this new data model. Lastly, we suggest some next steps for moving towards local-first software: for researchers, for app developers, and a startup opportunity for entrepreneurs.},

  abstract  = {Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDT) are usually classified as either state-based or operation-based. However, the standard definition of op-based CRDTs is very encompassing, allowing even sending the full-state, blurring the distinction. We introduce pure op-based CRDTs, that can only send operations to other replicas, drawing a clear distinction from state-based ones. Datatypes with commutative operations can be trivially implemented as pure op-based CRDTs using standard reliable causal delivery. We propose an extended API -- tagged reliable causal broadcast -- that provides causality information upon delivery, and show how it can be used to also implement other datatypes having non-commutative operations, through the use of a PO-Log  -- a partially ordered log of operations -- inside the datatype. A semantically-based PO-Log compaction framework, using both causality and what we denote by causal stability, allows obtaining very compact replica state for pure op-based CRDTs, while also benefiting from small message sizes.},

  abstract  = {Building scalable and highly available geo-replicated file systems is hard. These systems need to resolve conflicts that emerge in concurrent operations in a way that maintains file system invariants, is meaningful to the user, and does not depart from the traditional file system interface. Conflict resolution in existing systems often leads to unexpected or inconsistent results. This paper introduces ElmerFS, a geo-replicated, truly concurrent file system designed with the aim of addressing these challenges. ElmerFS is based on two key ideas: (1) the use of Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for representing file system structures, which ensures that replicas converge to a correct state, and (2) conflict resolution rules, which are determined by the choice of CRDT types and their composition, are designed with the principle of being intuitive to the user. We argue that if the state of the file system after resolving a conflict conveys to the user the resolved conflict in an intuitive way, the user can complement or reverse it using traditional file system operations. We discuss the challenges in the design of geo-replicated weakly consistent file systems, and present the design of ElmerFS.},

title = {Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System},
year = {1978},
month = {July},
abstract = {Jim Gray once told me that he had heard two different opinions of this paper: that it's trivial and that it's brilliant. I can't argue with the former, and I am disinclined to argue with the latter.

The origin of this paper was the note The Maintenance of Duplicate Databases by Paul Johnson and Bob Thomas. I believe their note introduced the idea of using message timestamps in a distributed algorithm. I happen to have a solid, visceral understanding of special relativity (see [5]). This enabled me to grasp immediately the essence of what they were trying to do. Special relativity teaches us that there is no invariant total ordering of events in space-time; different observers can disagree about which of two events happened first. There is only a partial order in which an event e1 precedes an event e2 iff e1 can causally affect e2. I realized that the essence of Johnson and Thomas's algorithm was the use of timestamps to provide a total ordering of events that was consistent with the causal order. This realization may have been brilliant. Having realized it, everything else was trivial. Because Thomas and Johnson didn't understand exactly what they were doing, they didn't get the algorithm quite right; their algorithm permitted anomalous behavior that essentially violated causality. I quickly wrote a short note pointing this out and correcting the algorithm.

It didn't take me long to realize that an algorithm for totally ordering events could be used to implement any distributed system. A distributed system can be described as a particular sequential state machine that is implemented with a network of processors. The ability to totally order the input requests leads immediately to an algorithm to implement an arbitrary state machine by a network of processors, and hence to implement any distributed system. So, I wrote this paper, which is about how to implement an arbitrary distributed state machine. As an illustration, I used the simplest example of a distributed system I could think of--a distributed mutual exclusion algorithm.

This is my most often cited paper. Many computer scientists claim to have read it. But I have rarely encountered anyone who was aware that the paper said anything about state machines. People seem to think that it is about either the causality relation on events in a distributed system, or the distributed mutual exclusion problem. People have insisted that there is nothing about state machines in the paper. I've even had to go back and reread it to convince myself that I really did remember what I had written.

The paper describes the synchronization of logical clocks. As something of an afterthought, I decided to see what kind of synchronization it provided for real-time clocks. So, I included a theorem about real-time synchronization. I was rather surprised by how difficult the proof turned out to be. This was an indication of what lay ahead in [62].
