# Tree CRDTs with Highly Available Move Operations

This repository contains the report and source code for Felix Whitefield's BSc Computer Science, third year project.

The two algorithms implemented are:

* "A highly-availble move operation for replicated trees" [link](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/move-op.pdf)
* Lumina - A new algorithm created during this project, with inspiration taken from the algorithm above, as well as the following:
  * "A coordination-free, convergent, and safe replicated tree" [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04828.pdf)
